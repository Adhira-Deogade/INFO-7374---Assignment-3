My name is Brandon and I'll be your conference facilitator today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\",\n",
              " \"I would now like to turn the program over to your host for today's conference, Steve Winoker Vice President of Investor Communications. Please go ahead sir.\",\n",
              " 'Steve Winoker',\n",
              " \"Thanks, Brandon and good morning and welcome to GE's Fourth Quarter Earnings Webcast. I'm joined by our Chairman and CEO Larry Culp; and CFO, Jamie Miller. Before we start, I'd like to remind you that the press release, presentation and supplemental have been available since earlier today on our investor website at www.ge.com/investors.\",\n",
              " 'Please note that some of the statements we are making today are forward looking and are based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. As described in our SEC filings and on our website, those elements can change as the world changes.',\n",
              " \"And now, I'll turn the call over to Larry\",\n",
              " 'Larry Culp',\n",
              " \"Thank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us. Our comments are going to be a bit longer than usual this morning to help you understand where we are and where we're going. But rest assured, we'll leave as much time as we can for questions at the end.\",\n",
              " \"First, I'd like to start by welcoming Steve to the GE team. I've known him for over a decade. Steve's already had positive impact here at GE and I'm sure, he'll do the same for you, our investors going forward. I'm here today because I believe in GE. There is no company on earth with a scale of GE's global reach, brand, talent and long-term customer relationships. We have leading technology in key infrastructure markets with high barriers to entry and strong aftermarket streams. We're poised to capture recurring revenues on a global installed base of almost 70,000 engines more than 70 -- 7,000 gas turbines and aero-derivatives, more than 40,000 onshore wind turbines and more than 4 million Healthcare Systems. In short, GE matters. We've identified clear opportunities to improve our performance and we are working to address them at root cause.\",\n",
              " \"We have the right portfolio of strategy and I'm confident the company is capable of gaining profitable share and creating long-term value for our shareholders. So let me cover where we stand on providing an outlook. Then I'll address some of the company changes followed by updates on our results, the balance sheet, capital and power. Jamie will take you through more details on the quarter and then I'll wrap with some metrics and comments to help you frame the outlook for 2019 before Q&A.\",\n",
              " \"Let's start with the outlook because investors want to know how we expect to perform financially and you should expect to come from a place of reality. Simply put the how much is important but the how is far more fundamental. We have a good line of sight in most of our businesses today including Aviation and Healthcare.\",\n",
              " \"For the industrial portfolio in total, we will provide you with our outlook for organic growth and we'll do so directionally on operating margins and free cash flow. We will give you a more detailed outlook in the near term but not today. For Power, we are resetting the baseline. We are reviewing every single project and contract and digging deeper to understand costs and benefits with respect to restructuring, market and commercial execution, improvement opportunities, legacy project issues and our service operations. We're gaining more meaningful insights into the paths for near and long-term earnings and cash potential of this business. This work takes time especially with the new structure and leadership team.\",\n",
              " \"In the spirit of providing you with all the information we have as soon as we have it, I'll speak to what I have found over the last 120 days. We were executing against the key priorities we laid out in June and again in October. Simply put deleveraging the balance sheet and strengthening our businesses starting with Power. Remember beyond Power, it's important to recognize the underlying strengths in our businesses where the story is about enhancing our competitive advantage and delivering for customers and shareholders.\",\n",
              " \"With respect to delevering, we've taken the following actions: We've reduced the quarterly dividend retaining $4 billion per year; accelerated the sale of a portion of our BHGE ownership stake raising $3.7 billion; and changed the structure of our transaction with Wabtec enabling us to retain an incremental $2 billion stake. We're demonstrating our seriousness and the flexibility with respect to our decisions to recut the BHGE and Wabtec deals in particular. We closed Distributed Power for $2.8 billion of net cash in the quarter.\",\n",
              " \"For the year, we signed or completed substantially all of our $20 billion industrial asset sale plan, which had targeted roughly $10 billion in proceeds. We also announced the sale of ServiceMax in the fourth quarter. We completed $8 billion of capital asset sales and other actions in the quarter bringing our total for the year to $15 billion, which were executed at book value or better. We're more than halfway through the total of $25 billion capital asset sale program, which we expect to complete this year.\",\n",
              " \"Today, we have announced that we've reached an agreement in principle with the United States Department of Justice to settle the FIRREA investigation of WMC. GE will pay the United States a civil penalty of $1.5 billion consistent with our reserve recorded for this matter in the first quarter of last year. We've taken the following actions to strengthen our businesses.\",\n",
              " \"In 2018, our corporate headquarters cost was $1.2 billion down $400 million from $1.6 billion in 2017. We have begun transferring a significant portion of headcount and activities that were previously managed at corporate to the segments or to third parties with over 6,500 full-time employees transferred to-date. We're confident that as we move more activity and headcount closer to those that are directly accountable, we will see additional savings.\",\n",
              " \"Good examples include the recently announced agreement with Genpact around our global operations activities and the delayering and reorganization of our Global Growth Organization. Our changes in Power followed a similar approach. We have $1.6 billion of cost at Power headquarters and expect to produce that amount by $300 million for headquarter's overhead functions. And as we distribute the remaining cost to the business units, we expect that they will find additional savings over time.\",\n",
              " \"We announced this week that we will be delayering the headquarter levels at Renewable Energy. And yesterday announced that we are bringing GE's grid, solar and storage assets into that business creating an end-to-end offering from renewables customers as the demand for renewable power generation and grid integration continues to grow globally. We're strengthening our senior team. We've brought in fresh eyes that are already having an impact.\",\n",
              " \"We're combining new perspectives from strong external talent, proven GE leaders with domain expertise and entrepreneurial spirit, next-gen thinkers as well as leaders with deep customer relationships. From a governance perspective, Paula Reynolds joined our Board of Directors bringing extensive experience in both the Energy and Insurance industries. The majority of our Directors now are new since 2017 and I'm finding the Board deeply engaged in all matters of our business\",\n",
              " \"Our audit committee also announced that they will move forward with the tender process for the appointment of GE's independent audit firm. And finally, we announced our plan to combine the digital businesses into an independently operated IoT Software business with employee equity a separate Board and the ability to raise capital and operate like a start-up. We're on the precipice of something great. We're getting a 100 years of domain and hardware expertise and growing out of our digital DNA over the last several decades.\",\n",
              " 'As my friend, Jim Collins of \"good-to-great\" fame might say, it\\'s a start. But we have much more work to do. So let me now share with you, how I\\'ve talked with our team about how we will do it. Number one, is managing first and foremost for operational performance. Preparing for the earnings call, my first month on the job showed me that we often start with corporate and bring in the business leaders including the CEO later. We turned that around this quarter holding operating reviews first and then preparing for this call. Those reviews were tightly focused on the how we can do and how do we get better, more so than how do we explain what just happened. Let me give you an example.',\n",
              " 'Previous P&L reviews focused on revenue, contribution margin and base cost and then, of course, operating profit. The same high-level framing I saw on the Board room. No more. We now get into much more operating detail, volume, price, mix, material and labor productivity overhead and operating expenses like R&D sales and marketing and G&A, all of which are critical to understanding and then improving the business.',\n",
              " \"The second is a focus on putting our customer at the center of all we do. Over the past few months, I've spent time with our customers in China, the Middle East, Europe and here in the US. I've learned that what they value is not always aligned with how we measure our own performance.\",\n",
              " \"Take quality. When I ask about quality internally, I often hear about our cost of quality, which measures our issues rather than how the customer experiences us. We're shifting our perspectives so that we understand and measure ourselves the way customers do and work backwards from there. The third area is having fewer and more impactful priorities. GE has ambition like no other company I've ever seen and that's mostly a good thing but we need to focus our attention to more of the things that matter most, so we can move them the furthest.\",\n",
              " \"At a company level, we've committed to the two priorities I mentioned earlier: Deleveraging the balance sheet and strengthening the businesses starting with Power. I'd now like to address some of the areas of importance that are high on my priority list. First, our high-level financial results. We ended the year with adjusted EPS of $0.65. GAAP EPS of negative $2.43 and industrial free cash flow of $4.5 billion. Our backlog stands at $391 billion up 5% year-on-year with equipment at $89 billion up 4%; and service at $302 billion up 5%.\",\n",
              " 'For the fourth quarter, our industrial free cash flow was $4.9 billion. While cash flow was negatively impacted by the weakness in Power, we were encouraged by the strong cash generation in the other businesses. We delivered adjusted EPS of $0.17 and GAAP EPS of $0.08. Jamie will take you through all this in more detail in a moment.',\n",
              " \"Next to the balance sheet. As I've stated already, we are reducing our debt levels both at Industrial and GE Capital. We know full well that our shareholders own all debt obligations across GE but these are two distinct sets of businesses with different financing needs and different capital structures and therefore we analyze their leverage separately. In industrial, we are targeting a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of less than 2.5x over the next few years.\",\n",
              " 'Our Healthcare, transportation and BHGE separations can provide sources of roughly $50 billion toward that goal. Our Healthcare team continues to prepare for public company separation and that is progressing very well. We expect to monetize up to just under 50% of our Healthcare business. I talked earlier to the GE Transportation merger with Wabtec and the amended terms to increase our cash proceeds and we will sell down our remaining 50% ownership in BHGE in an orderly manner over time building on the actions, we took in November.',\n",
              " \"Overall our liquidity position remains strong with $16.8 billion of industrial cash and funding lines of $40 billion. Now on capital, we are targeting a debt-to-equity ratio of less than 4x by 2020. In 2018, we paid down capital's external debt balance by $21 billion and we executed $15 billion in asset sales at book more than half of our $25 billion asset disposition program. Capital ended the year with a $124 billion of assets including $15 billion of liquidity in line with our goal to materially shrink this business.\",\n",
              " \"To be clear, we have no plans to sell GECAS. We expect to contribute approximately $4 billion of parent support in 2019. We've listened to you on the insurance front and we're preparing increased disclosures in line with peers, which will be available with our 10-K release. Jamie will cover some of that detail shortly. And then finally on Power. Let me share with you the root causes of our underperformance as I see them today and the actions we're taking to address each one.\",\n",
              " 'First as I said, last quarter we were late to embrace the realities of the secular and cyclical pressures in the business. Recent data suggests that the market for new generating capacity is settling in to the 25 to 30 gigawatts range for the foreseeable future. We continue to believe gas will play an important role in global electrification but we have to resize our cost structure, our capital expenses and our supply chains to this new reality now.',\n",
              " \"As a result last year, we reduced headcount by 10,000 or 15% in the business, consolidated our footprint by 30% and took out $900 million of base cost exiting at a $1 billion lower run rate. Embracing market reality means a more appropriate revenue outlook, one that is further grounded in the reality of our $92 billion backlog rather than in the hope of new orders not yet won. Second Power faces a number of nonoperational headwinds and we expect a high water mark in this regard this year. These include legal settlements and legacy project erosion principally driven by the Alstom acquisition. There's also the runoff of the effects of past long-term receivables factoring and other programs.\",\n",
              " 'Over the next few years, these effects should come down substantially. Third, we need to execute better. Running Power better means improved daily management in how we sell make and service our products. Let me give you a few examples. We had separate teams of managers commissioning new plants owning a warranty period and overseeing the services contracts after the warranty.',\n",
              " 'Now, we present one face to the customer, who is accountable for the best long-term economic answer both for the customer and GE. We put the sales organization under one leader with deep domain expertise and are coordinating better on contract negotiations. We now have more experienced people, owning negotiations and responsible for project cost. We performed risk assessments of our existing 400 equipment contracts to identify cost and execution risks. We also performed a similar assessment on the 750 CSA contracts to identify price and utilization risk.',\n",
              " \"We have overhauled our commercial underwriting processes to set more realistic commitments and returns from the start. This is hard work but I'm encouraged by the Power's team's dedication to proactively address these issues at their root cause. Fixing Power will take time and in turn will take time for the changes, we're making to our daily operations to be reflected in our financial results but we are improving and I'm confident that those changes will come.\",\n",
              " \"As I've met with customers around the world, I'm really been struck by their sentiment. They're rooting for us. They want us to succeed and they want to know how they can help. So in summary, we're taking action, taking action on the priorities we laid out to you, deleveraging our balance sheet and strengthening our businesses starting with Power.\",\n",
              " 'Jamie will now take you through the detailed financial results.',\n",
              " 'Jamie Miller',\n",
              " \"Thanks. Larry. I'll start with the fourth quarter summary. Orders were $34.1 billion down 1% reported and up 4% organically with particular strength in equipment orders up 7% organically driven by aviation commercial engines and renewables. The services orders were up 1% organically. Revenues were up 5%, industrial segment revenues were up 2% reported and 8% organically driven by renewables Aviation Oil & Gas Healthcare and Transportation.\",\n",
              " 'Equipment revenues grew 10% and services were up 6% organically. Industrial profit margins were 7.5% in the quarter down 150 basis points year-over-year on a reported and organic basis driven by significant declines in Power and Renewables. For the year, margins were down 80 basis points organically. Industrial profit was down 16% in the quarter with Aviation, Healthcare and Baker Hughes GE all delivering strong profit growth offset mostly by Power. Specifically Aviation had another outstanding quarter and year expanding total year margins while shipping over 1,100 LEAP engines. Net earnings per share was $0.07, which includes losses from discontinued operations related to GE Capital. GAAP continuing EPS was $0.08 and adjusted EPS was $0.17.',\n",
              " \"I'll walk the GAAP continuing EPS to adjusted EPS on the right side of the page. Starting from GAAP. Continuing EPS was $0.08 and we had $0.06 of gains principally from the sale of Distributed Power. As you will recall in the third quarter, we booked the $22 billion impairment charge related to Power goodwill based on our best estimate at that time. And during the fourth quarter, we finalized our analysis and booked an incremental $69 million charge for Power following the third quarter charge. We also recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $94 million in renewables at our Hydro business. Combined these charges were $0.02 impact. On restructuring and other items, we incurred $0.07 of charges principally at Corporate and Power as we continue to resize those segments in line with our stated plan including $0.02 of charges related to business development transaction expenses and $0.01 for our share of Baker Hughes GE's restructuring.\",\n",
              " 'Lastly, we realized a $0.01 negative impact from US tax reform as we updated our estimate of the transition tax and other aspects of the enactment of the new law. Our current accrual reflects the effects of tax reform enactment based on guidance issued through year-end. Excluding these items adjusted EPS was $0.17 in the quarter.',\n",
              " 'Moving to cash, adjusted industrial free cash flow was $4.9 billion for the quarter, $1.9 billion lower than the prior year driven primarily by a lower progress collections. Income depreciation and amortization totaled $2.3 billion. Working capital was positive $2.3 billion for the quarter as we reduced over $1 billion of inventory on a higher fourth quarter volume and grew progress collections by $500 million primarily in renewables from strong PTC-driven orders.',\n",
              " 'Contract assets were a source of cash of $900 million as we saw higher services billings in aviation driven by higher fleet utilization and spare parts consumption from strong air traffic and we spent about $1 billion in gross CapEx or $600 million ex-Baker Hughes GE. For the year, we generated $4.5 billion of adjusted industrial free cash flow and we ended the year with higher volume in the fourth quarter as is typical for our businesses. And to provide you with more detail, Power used $2.7 billion in free cash flow for the year due to a combination of restructuring costs, nonoperational headwinds as well as execution and market issues.',\n",
              " \"Next, I'll cover liquidity. On the left side of the page, you can see the walk of the GE cash balance. We ended the fourth quarter with $16.8 billion of industrial cash in the bank excluding Baker Hughes GE. And for the total year, we had industrial free cash flow of $4.5 billion. We paid dividends of $4.2 billion and as of the first quarter of 2019, you'll recall that the dividend is decreasing to $0.01 per share per quarter, which will preserve about $4 billion of cash in 2019. We generated cash proceeds of $5.9 billion net of taxes related to our industrial disposition principally Industrial Solutions, Value-Based Care and Dis Power. And together with Wabtec that gets to the more than $10 billion we had talked about previously.\",\n",
              " 'Earlier in the year, we assumed $6 billion of debt from GE Capital to fund the principal pension plan, which was completed in the third quarter. Alstom and GE exercised their JV redemption rights and call options, which we settled for $3.1 billion in the fourth quarter. These entities operate at a loss. So the consolidation of 100% of the financials negatively impacted fourth quarter and will be an income headwind for us of about $300 million in 2019. We also completed a secondary offering for approximately 100 million Baker Hughes GE shares as well as a direct stock buyback with Baker Hughes GE for 65 million shares bringing our ownership stake to 50.4% in the fourth quarter.',\n",
              " \"These actions combined with other Baker Hughes GE buybacks during the year totaled $4.4 billion in cash proceeds. The $2.5 billion of other cash includes a number of items including about $900 million of investments in our Aviation business primarily from the first half of the year; $900 million of short data derivative hedge settlements that we used to mitigate risks across the portfolio; and $400 million of FX translation on our non-US dollar-denominated cash. Running with a higher cash balance will help us address inter-quarter funding needs. In line with our goal to reduce reliance on short-term funding, peak short-term funding needs declined from $19.7 billion in the fourth quarter of '17 to $14.8 billion in the fourth quarter of '18. These were funded with commercial paper and some utilization of our credit facilities.\",\n",
              " \"As we execute dispositions in 2019, we expect our intra-quarter funding needs to continue to decline and would expect to use a mix of commercial paper, credit facilities and excess cash at GE Capital to efficiently fund these needs. At the end of the year, commercial paper outstanding was $3 billion and we had access to $40 billion of committed revolving credit facilities with zero drawn. These lines are available to draw at any time and they don't have financial covenants ratings triggers or material adverse change clauses. As you know, our credit rating was downgraded from A to BBB+ with a stable outlook in early fourth quarter.\",\n",
              " 'This impact has been manageable with less than $15 million of collateral postings and a smooth transition to a Tier two commercial paper program. We continue to target a sustainable rating in the single A range.',\n",
              " \"Now, I'll take you through financial policy and leverage. We remain committed to our financial policy of a target single A rating a leverage level of less than 2.5x net debt-to-EBITDA and ultimately a dividend level in line with our peers. Deleveraging both GE and GE Capital is a priority and we have significant sources to achieve our goals.\",\n",
              " \"As Larry mentioned, we view these businesses differently with different balance sheets and capital structure needs and therefore we analyze their leverage separately. Our goal is leverage for the GE industrial businesses of less than 2.5x net debt-to-EBITDA. We plan to make significant progress toward this goal by the end of 2020 and as a reminder when we speak about net debt, we're talking about debt adjusted for pensions, operating leases and a portion of preferred stock and cash. Measured on this basis, GE Industrial net debt at the end of 2018 was $55 billion. As we look out over the next couple of years, we expect to have roughly $50 billion of industrial sources that can be used to delever and derisk the company.\",\n",
              " 'These sources include $18 billion of debt and pension transfer to Healthcare and more than $30 billion of cash proceeds from the monetization of up to just under 50% of Healthcare, 100% of our remaining stake in Baker Hughes GE and our stake in transportation. These sources will be used in part to reduce GE net debt by more than $30 billion including repaying a significant part of the $14 billion of debt transferred from GE Capital and reducing commercial paper. The parent also plans to contribute $4 billion to GE Capital in 2019 to maintain adequate capital levels there.',\n",
              " 'At GE Capital, we have a plan to reduce our debt to equity ratio to less than 4x by the end of 2020. GE Capital began the quarter with $70 billion of debt and ended with $66 billion while our total assets measure $124 billion. For the year, we made significant progress at GE Capital paying down $21 billion of external debt, taking down leverage by 1.4 turns including reducing commercial paper from $5 billion to zero.',\n",
              " \"GE Capital ended 2018 with $15 billion of liquidity. Over the next two years, we expect to generate additional sources of cash from asset sales, including $10 billion in 2019 from completing our GE Capital $25 billion asset reduction plan. We'll have cash from the pay down of most of the debt transferred to GE and capital support from GE. We have reached an agreement in principle on WMC that we expect to conclude expeditiously. And in 2019 and 2020, GE Capital will pay down $25 billion of scheduled debt maturities and continue to contribute about $2 billion per year of capital to our insurance businesses as previously disclosed.

I got the word last night for example within Power of a project that is looking very good where we're frankly -- we are not the low bid, right? I think that just speaks to the way we're able to communicate the value of our technology. We know in these businesses from Healthcare to renewables price is a reality. We want to be smarter around pricing, at the same time, frankly when you hear us talk about labor and material productivity, we really want to push that hard and do that in line with market realities, so that we can maintain margins in light of some of those pressures.\",\n",

Power really with respect to the enhanced discipline on new projects and bids as Larry talked about. In renewables, we're seeing that pressure moderate as we move throughout the year as well primarily as we're moving through that PTC cycle.

They're likely to find opportunities for further savings. But we don't do it primarily for the cost reduction. I think we really do it to help drive visibility and accountability P&L-by-P&L.

              "[\"Thank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us. Our comments are going to be a bit longer than usual this morning to help you understand where we are and where we're going. But rest assured, we'll leave as much time as we can for questions at the end.\",\n",
              " \"First, I'd like to start by welcoming Steve to the GE team. I've known him for over a decade. Steve's already had positive impact here at GE and I'm sure, he'll do the same for you, our investors going forward. I'm here today because I believe in GE. There is no company on earth with a scale of GE's global reach, brand, talent and long-term customer relationships. We have leading technology in key infrastructure markets with high barriers to entry and strong aftermarket streams. We're poised to capture recurring revenues on a global installed base of almost 70,000 engines more than 70 -- 7,000 gas turbines and aero-derivatives, more than 40,000 onshore wind turbines and more than 4 million Healthcare Systems. In short, GE matters. We've identified clear opportunities to improve our performance and we are working to address them at root cause.\",\n",
              " \"We have the right portfolio of strategy and I'm confident the company is capable of gaining profitable share and creating long-term value for our shareholders. So let me cover where we stand on providing an outlook. Then I'll address some of the company changes followed by updates on our results, the balance sheet, capital and power. Jamie will take you through more details on the quarter and then I'll wrap with some metrics and comments to help you frame the outlook for 2019 before Q&A.\",\n",
              " \"Let's start with the outlook because investors want to know how we expect to perform financially and you should expect to come from a place of reality. Simply put the how much is important but the how is far more fundamental. We have a good line of sight in most of our businesses today including Aviation and Healthcare.\",\n",
              " \"For the industrial portfolio in total, we will provide you with our outlook for organic growth and we'll do so directionally on operating margins and free cash flow. We will give you a more detailed outlook in the near term but not today. For Power, we are resetting the baseline. We are reviewing every single project and contract and digging deeper to understand costs and benefits with respect to restructuring, market and commercial execution, improvement opportunities, legacy project issues and our service operations. We're gaining more meaningful insights into the paths for near and long-term earnings and cash potential of this business. This work takes time especially with the new structure and leadership team.\",\n",
              " \"In the spirit of providing you with all the information we have as soon as we have it, I'll speak to what I have found over the last 120 days. We were executing against the key priorities we laid out in June and again in October. Simply put deleveraging the balance sheet and strengthening our businesses starting with Power. Remember beyond Power, it's important to recognize the underlying strengths in our businesses where the story is about enhancing our competitive advantage and delivering for customers and shareholders.\",\n",
              " \"With respect to delevering, we've taken the following actions: We've reduced the quarterly dividend retaining $4 billion per year; accelerated the sale of a portion of our BHGE ownership stake raising $3.7 billion; and changed the structure of our transaction with Wabtec enabling us to retain an incremental $2 billion stake. We're demonstrating our seriousness and the flexibility with respect to our decisions to recut the BHGE and Wabtec deals in particular. We closed Distributed Power for $2.8 billion of net cash in the quarter.\",\n",
              " \"For the year, we signed or completed substantially all of our $20 billion industrial asset sale plan, which had targeted roughly $10 billion in proceeds. We also announced the sale of ServiceMax in the fourth quarter. We completed $8 billion of capital asset sales and other actions in the quarter bringing our total for the year to $15 billion, which were executed at book value or better. We're more than halfway through the total of $25 billion capital asset sale program, which we expect to complete this year.\",\n",
              " \"Today, we have announced that we've reached an agreement in principle with the United States Department of Justice to settle the FIRREA investigation of WMC. GE will pay the United States a civil penalty of $1.5 billion consistent with our reserve recorded for this matter in the first quarter of last year. We've taken the following actions to strengthen our businesses.\",\n",
              " \"In 2018, our corporate headquarters cost was $1.2 billion down $400 million from $1.6 billion in 2017. We have begun transferring a significant portion of headcount and activities that were previously managed at corporate to the segments or to third parties with over 6,500 full-time employees transferred to-date. We're confident that as we move more activity and headcount closer to those that are directly accountable, we will see additional savings.\",\n",
              " \"Good examples include the recently announced agreement with Genpact around our global operations activities and the delayering and reorganization of our Global Growth Organization. Our changes in Power followed a similar approach. We have $1.6 billion of cost at Power headquarters and expect to produce that amount by $300 million for headquarter's overhead functions. And as we distribute the remaining cost to the business units, we expect that they will find additional savings over time.\",\n",
              " \"We announced this week that we will be delayering the headquarter levels at Renewable Energy. And yesterday announced that we are bringing GE's grid, solar and storage assets into that business creating an end-to-end offering from renewables customers as the demand for renewable power generation and grid integration continues to grow globally. We're strengthening our senior team. We've brought in fresh eyes that are already having an impact.\",\n",
              " \"We're combining new perspectives from strong external talent, proven GE leaders with domain expertise and entrepreneurial spirit, next-gen thinkers as well as leaders with deep customer relationships. From a governance perspective, Paula Reynolds joined our Board of Directors bringing extensive experience in both the Energy and Insurance industries. The majority of our Directors now are new since 2017 and I'm finding the Board deeply engaged in all matters of our business\",\n",
              " \"Our audit committee also announced that they will move forward with the tender process for the appointment of GE's independent audit firm. And finally, we announced our plan to combine the digital businesses into an independently operated IoT Software business with employee equity a separate Board and the ability to raise capital and operate like a start-up. We're on the precipice of something great. We're getting a 100 years of domain and hardware expertise and growing out of our digital DNA over the last several decades.\",\n",
              " 'As my friend, Jim Collins of \"good-to-great\" fame might say, it\\'s a start. But we have much more work to do. So let me now share with you, how I\\'ve talked with our team about how we will do it. Number one, is managing first and foremost for operational performance. Preparing for the earnings call, my first month on the job showed me that we often start with corporate and bring in the business leaders including the CEO later. We turned that around this quarter holding operating reviews first and then preparing for this call. Those reviews were tightly focused on the how we can do and how do we get better, more so than how do we explain what just happened. Let me give you an example.',\n",
              " 'Previous P&L reviews focused on revenue, contribution margin and base cost and then, of course, operating profit. The same high-level framing I saw on the Board room. No more. We now get into much more operating detail, volume, price, mix, material and labor productivity overhead and operating expenses like R&D sales and marketing and G&A, all of which are critical to understanding and then improving the business.',\n",
              " \"The second is a focus on putting our customer at the center of all we do. Over the past few months, I've spent time with our customers in China, the Middle East, Europe and here in the US. I've learned that what they value is not always aligned with how we measure our own performance.\",\n",
              " \"Take quality. When I ask about quality internally, I often hear about our cost of quality, which measures our issues rather than how the customer experiences us. We're shifting our perspectives so that we understand and measure ourselves the way customers do and work backwards from there. The third area is having fewer and more impactful priorities. GE has ambition like no other company I've ever seen and that's mostly a good thing but we need to focus our attention to more of the things that matter most, so we can move them the furthest.\",\n",
              " \"At a company level, we've committed to the two priorities I mentioned earlier: Deleveraging the balance sheet and strengthening the businesses starting with Power. I'd now like to address some of the areas of importance that are high on my priority list. First, our high-level financial results. We ended the year with adjusted EPS of $0.65. GAAP EPS of negative $2.43 and industrial free cash flow of $4.5 billion. Our backlog stands at $391 billion up 5% year-on-year with equipment at $89 billion up 4%; and service at $302 billion up 5%.\",\n",
              " 'For the fourth quarter, our industrial free cash flow was $4.9 billion. While cash flow was negatively impacted by the weakness in Power, we were encouraged by the strong cash generation in the other businesses. We delivered adjusted EPS of $0.17 and GAAP EPS of $0.08. Jamie will take you through all this in more detail in a moment.',\n",
              " \"Next to the balance sheet. As I've stated already, we are reducing our debt levels both at Industrial and GE Capital. We know full well that our shareholders own all debt obligations across GE but these are two distinct sets of businesses with different financing needs and different capital structures and therefore we analyze their leverage separately. In industrial, we are targeting a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of less than 2.5x over the next few years.\",\n",
              " 'Our Healthcare, transportation and BHGE separations can provide sources of roughly $50 billion toward that goal. Our Healthcare team continues to prepare for public company separation and that is progressing very well. We expect to monetize up to just under 50% of our Healthcare business. I talked earlier to the GE Transportation merger with Wabtec and the amended terms to increase our cash proceeds and we will sell down our remaining 50% ownership in BHGE in an orderly manner over time building on the actions, we took in November.',\n",
              " \"Overall our liquidity position remains strong with $16.8 billion of industrial cash and funding lines of $40 billion. Now on capital, we are targeting a debt-to-equity ratio of less than 4x by 2020. In 2018, we paid down capital's external debt balance by $21 billion and we executed $15 billion in asset sales at book more than half of our $25 billion asset disposition program. Capital ended the year with a $124 billion of assets including $15 billion of liquidity in line with our goal to materially shrink this business.\",\n",
              " \"To be clear, we have no plans to sell GECAS. We expect to contribute approximately $4 billion of parent support in 2019. We've listened to you on the insurance front and we're preparing increased disclosures in line with peers, which will be available with our 10-K release. Jamie will cover some of that detail shortly. And then finally on Power. Let me share with you the root causes of our underperformance as I see them today and the actions we're taking to address each one.\",\n",
              " 'First as I said, last quarter we were late to embrace the realities of the secular and cyclical pressures in the business. Recent data suggests that the market for new generating capacity is settling in to the 25 to 30 gigawatts range for the foreseeable future. We continue to believe gas will play an important role in global electrification but we have to resize our cost structure, our capital expenses and our supply chains to this new reality now.',\n",
              " \"As a result last year, we reduced headcount by 10,000 or 15% in the business, consolidated our footprint by 30% and took out $900 million of base cost exiting at a $1 billion lower run rate. Embracing market reality means a more appropriate revenue outlook, one that is further grounded in the reality of our $92 billion backlog rather than in the hope of new orders not yet won. Second Power faces a number of nonoperational headwinds and we expect a high water mark in this regard this year. These include legal settlements and legacy project erosion principally driven by the Alstom acquisition. There's also the runoff of the effects of past long-term receivables factoring and other programs.\",\n",
              " 'Over the next few years, these effects should come down substantially. Third, we need to execute better. Running Power better means improved daily management in how we sell make and service our products. Let me give you a few examples. We had separate teams of managers commissioning new plants owning a warranty period and overseeing the services contracts after the warranty.',\n",
              " 'Now, we present one face to the customer, who is accountable for the best long-term economic answer both for the customer and GE. We put the sales organization under one leader with deep domain expertise and are coordinating better on contract negotiations. We now have more experienced people, owning negotiations and responsible for project cost. We performed risk assessments of our existing 400 equipment contracts to identify cost and execution risks. We also performed a similar assessment on the 750 CSA contracts to identify price and utilization risk.',\n",
              " \"We have overhauled our commercial underwriting processes to set more realistic commitments and returns from the start. This is hard work but I'm encouraged by the Power's team's dedication to proactively address these issues at their root cause. Fixing Power will take time and in turn will take time for the changes, we're making to our daily operations to be reflected in our financial results but we are improving and I'm confident that those changes will come.\",\n",
              " \"As I've met with customers around the world, I'm really been struck by their sentiment. They're rooting for us. They want us to succeed and they want to know how they can help. So in summary, we're taking action, taking action on the priorities we laid out to you, deleveraging our balance sheet and strengthening our businesses starting with Power.\",\n",
              " 'Jamie will now take you through the detailed financial results.',\n",
              " 'Jamie Miller',\n",
              " \"Thanks. Larry. I'll start with the fourth quarter summary. Orders were $34.1 billion down 1% reported and up 4% organically with particular strength in equipment orders up 7% organically driven by aviation commercial engines and renewables. The services orders were up 1% organically. Revenues were up 5%, industrial segment revenues were up 2% reported and 8% organically driven by renewables Aviation Oil & Gas Healthcare and Transportation.\",\n",
              " 'Equipment revenues grew 10% and services were up 6% organically. Industrial profit margins were 7.5% in the quarter down 150 basis points year-over-year on a reported and organic basis driven by significant declines in Power and Renewables. For the year, margins were down 80 basis points organically. Industrial profit was down 16% in the quarter with Aviation, Healthcare and Baker Hughes GE all delivering strong profit growth offset mostly by Power. Specifically Aviation had another outstanding quarter and year expanding total year margins while shipping over 1,100 LEAP engines. Net earnings per share was $0.07, which includes losses from discontinued operations related to GE Capital. GAAP continuing EPS was $0.08 and adjusted EPS was $0.17.',\n",
              " \"I'll walk the GAAP continuing EPS to adjusted EPS on the right side of the page. Starting from GAAP. Continuing EPS was $0.08 and we had $0.06 of gains principally from the sale of Distributed Power. As you will recall in the third quarter, we booked the $22 billion impairment charge related to Power goodwill based on our best estimate at that time. And during the fourth quarter, we finalized our analysis and booked an incremental $69 million charge for Power following the third quarter charge. We also recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $94 million in renewables at our Hydro business. Combined these charges were $0.02 impact. On restructuring and other items, we incurred $0.07 of charges principally at Corporate and Power as we continue to resize those segments in line with our stated plan including $0.02 of charges related to business development transaction expenses and $0.01 for our share of Baker Hughes GE's restructuring.\",\n",
              " 'Lastly, we realized a $0.01 negative impact from US tax reform as we updated our estimate of the transition tax and other aspects of the enactment of the new law. Our current accrual reflects the effects of tax reform enactment based on guidance issued through year-end. Excluding these items adjusted EPS was $0.17 in the quarter.',\n",
              " 'Moving to cash, adjusted industrial free cash flow was $4.9 billion for the quarter, $1.9 billion lower than the prior year driven primarily by a lower progress collections. Income depreciation and amortization totaled $2.3 billion. Working capital was positive $2.3 billion for the quarter as we reduced over $1 billion of inventory on a higher fourth quarter volume and grew progress collections by $500 million primarily in renewables from strong PTC-driven orders.',\n",
              " 'Contract assets were a source of cash of $900 million as we saw higher services billings in aviation driven by higher fleet utilization and spare parts consumption from strong air traffic and we spent about $1 billion in gross CapEx or $600 million ex-Baker Hughes GE. For the year, we generated $4.5 billion of adjusted industrial free cash flow and we ended the year with higher volume in the fourth quarter as is typical for our businesses. And to provide you with more detail, Power used $2.7 billion in free cash flow for the year due to a combination of restructuring costs, nonoperational headwinds as well as execution and market issues.',\n",
              " \"Next, I'll cover liquidity. On the left side of the page, you can see the walk of the GE cash balance. We ended the fourth quarter with $16.8 billion of industrial cash in the bank excluding Baker Hughes GE. And for the total year, we had industrial free cash flow of $4.5 billion. We paid dividends of $4.2 billion and as of the first quarter of 2019, you'll recall that the dividend is decreasing to $0.01 per share per quarter, which will preserve about $4 billion of cash in 2019. We generated cash proceeds of $5.9 billion net of taxes related to our industrial disposition principally Industrial Solutions, Value-Based Care and Dis Power. And together with Wabtec that gets to the more than $10 billion we had talked about previously.\",\n",
              " 'Earlier in the year, we assumed $6 billion of debt from GE Capital to fund the principal pension plan, which was completed in the third quarter. Alstom and GE exercised their JV redemption rights and call options, which we settled for $3.1 billion in the fourth quarter. These entities operate at a loss. So the consolidation of 100% of the financials negatively impacted fourth quarter and will be an income headwind for us of about $300 million in 2019. We also completed a secondary offering for approximately 100 million Baker Hughes GE shares as well as a direct stock buyback with Baker Hughes GE for 65 million shares bringing our ownership stake to 50.4% in the fourth quarter.',\n",
              " \"These actions combined with other Baker Hughes GE buybacks during the year totaled $4.4 billion in cash proceeds. The $2.5 billion of other cash includes a number of items including about $900 million of investments in our Aviation business primarily from the first half of the year; $900 million of short data derivative hedge settlements that we used to mitigate risks across the portfolio; and $400 million of FX translation on our non-US dollar-denominated cash. Running with a higher cash balance will help us address inter-quarter funding needs. In line with our goal to reduce reliance on short-term funding, peak short-term funding needs declined from $19.7 billion in the fourth quarter of '17 to $14.8 billion in the fourth quarter of '18. These were funded with commercial paper and some utilization of our credit facilities.\",\n",
              " \"As we execute dispositions in 2019, we expect our intra-quarter funding needs to continue to decline and would expect to use a mix of commercial paper, credit facilities and excess cash at GE Capital to efficiently fund these needs. At the end of the year, commercial paper outstanding was $3 billion and we had access to $40 billion of committed revolving credit facilities with zero drawn. These lines are available to draw at any time and they don't have financial covenants ratings triggers or material adverse change clauses. As you know, our credit rating was downgraded from A to BBB+ with a stable outlook in early fourth quarter.\",\n",
              " 'This impact has been manageable with less than $15 million of collateral postings and a smooth transition to a Tier two commercial paper program. We continue to target a sustainable rating in the single A range.',\n",
              " \"Now, I'll take you through financial policy and leverage. We remain committed to our financial policy of a target single A rating a leverage level of less than 2.5x net debt-to-EBITDA and ultimately a dividend level in line with our peers. Deleveraging both GE and GE Capital is a priority and we have significant sources to achieve our goals.\",\n",
              " \"As Larry mentioned, we view these businesses differently with different balance sheets and capital structure needs and therefore we analyze their leverage separately. Our goal is leverage for the GE industrial businesses of less than 2.5x net debt-to-EBITDA. We plan to make significant progress toward this goal by the end of 2020 and as a reminder when we speak about net debt, we're talking about debt adjusted for pensions, operating leases and a portion of preferred stock and cash. Measured on this basis, GE Industrial net debt at the end of 2018 was $55 billion. As we look out over the next couple of years, we expect to have roughly $50 billion of industrial sources that can be used to delever and derisk the company.\",\n",
              " 'These sources include $18 billion of debt and pension transfer to Healthcare and more than $30 billion of cash proceeds from the monetization of up to just under 50% of Healthcare, 100% of our remaining stake in Baker Hughes GE and our stake in transportation. These sources will be used in part to reduce GE net debt by more than $30 billion including repaying a significant part of the $14 billion of debt transferred from GE Capital and reducing commercial paper. The parent also plans to contribute $4 billion to GE Capital in 2019 to maintain adequate capital levels there.',\n",
              " 'At GE Capital, we have a plan to reduce our debt to equity ratio to less than 4x by the end of 2020. GE Capital began the quarter with $70 billion of debt and ended with $66 billion while our total assets measure $124 billion. For the year, we made significant progress at GE Capital paying down $21 billion of external debt, taking down leverage by 1.4 turns including reducing commercial paper from $5 billion to zero.',\n",
              " \"GE Capital ended 2018 with $15 billion of liquidity. Over the next two years, we expect to generate additional sources of cash from asset sales, including $10 billion in 2019 from completing our GE Capital $25 billion asset reduction plan. We'll have cash from the pay down of most of the debt transferred to GE and capital support from GE. We have reached an agreement in principle on WMC that we expect to conclude expeditiously. And in 2019 and 2020, GE Capital will pay down $25 billion of scheduled debt maturities and continue to contribute about $2 billion per year of capital to our insurance businesses as previously disclosed. We now don't expect to issue new debt until 2021.\",\n",
              " 'We are planning approximately $4 billion of capital contributions to GE Capital in 2019. This includes $1.5 billion for the WMC agreement in principal announced today and ensuring we have adequate risk-based capital levels for our current portfolio. Going forward, we anticipate funding any insurance capital requirements or strategic options through a combination of GE Capital earnings, asset sales, liquidity and GE parent support. While we have more work to do, we continue to make progress in strengthening the balance sheet.',\n",
              " \"Next on Power. Orders were down 19% in the quarter. Gas Power Systems orders were down 26%. For the year, Gas Power Systems orders were down 40%. We ended the year with a $9 billion backlog, which was down 8% year-over-year. This is consistent with our outlook for a 25 to 30 gigawatt market for the foreseeable future. Power Services orders were down 20%. Steam orders were up 61% and grid orders were down 13% for the year. Power revenue was down 25%. Gas Power Systems revenues were down 21%. Power Services revenue was also down 21%. During the quarter, we took $400 million of charges related to our CSA contracts, which impacts revenue. Excluding these charges Power Services revenue was down 11%. Steam revenue was down 30% on lower America's and Europe volume and grid was flat.\",\n",
              " 'Moving to profit. The segment loss $872 million in the fourth quarter. We performed our normal CSA reviews and while total utilization on the book is flat, we have seen lower utilization on some of our units in some geographies and some pricing pressure in contracts relative to ongoing market dynamics and we updated our assumptions to reflect a revised outlook in these areas.',\n",
              " 'In addition, we had our normal cost standard updates, which included updates to our cost standards including the impact of the stage-one blade issue as expected. This resulted in the $400 million of charges that I previously mentioned. In addition, we also incurred about $350 million of costs related to Gas Power Systems projects. Similar to the third quarter, we continue to experience project execution issues resulting in liquidated damages as well as partner execution issues. Grid profit was down year-over-year impacted negatively by the buyout of the Alstom share of the JV.',\n",
              " \"These items had a significant impact on Power's results and overall, we see the heavy duty gas turbine market is flat over the next few years and see significant opportunity to improve our own execution. Next on Aviation, which had another great quarter. Orders of $8.8 billion were up 12%. Equipment orders grew 20%, driven by continued strong momentum of the LEAP engine program up 56% versus prior year. Military engine orders were up 69% driven by the F414 and service orders grew 7%. Revenues of $8.5 billion grew 21%. Equipment revenues were up 13% on higher commercial engine partially offset by lower military volume.\",\n",
              " \"Specifically, we shipped 379 LEAP engines this quarter up 177 units year-over-year. And in total, we shipped 1,118 LEAP engines for the year. We're still behind on deliveries by about four weeks but the business expects to be back on schedule by mid-2019. Services revenue grew 26% with spares rate up 10% driven by higher fleet utilization and spare parts consumption from strong air traffic. Segment profit of $1.7 billion was up 24% on higher volumes, improved price and operating productivity and compared to the fourth quarter of last year, we shipped almost 90% more LEAP engines.\",\n",
              " \"Despite the negative mix from higher LEAP shipments operating profit margins of 20.4% expanded 60 basis points in the quarter and 130 basis points for the year. The LEAP engine continues to perform very well with a 58% win rate on the A320neo family and 81% win rate in the narrow-body segment when you add in Boeing 737 MAX and Comac C919. Utilization rates are over 95%. We continue to improve the cost position of the LEAP and over the last two years, we've taken out more than 40% of the cost of the engine and are ahead on the learning curve initially laid out for the program. The overall program will break even around 2021.\",\n",
              " \"Now, I'll provide some additional transparency on the engine transition in the narrow-body market. The mixing from CFM56 to LEAP resulted in a margin drag of approximately 160 basis points in 2018 and 130 basis points in the quarter. The business is successfully offsetting this margin pressure through continued growth in aftermarket services, military and changing the mix of company-funded R&D spend. In summary, another strong year for David and the aviation team. In renewables, renewables orders were up 19% versus prior year driven by onshore equipment up 9% and services up 32% on strong repower units.\",\n",
              " 'We shipped 44% more megawatts and onshore wind and saw strong orders bookings 3 gigawatts in the fourth quarter and 8.6 gigawatts for the year and we gained share. Revenues of $3.4 billion were up 28% mainly driven by onshore wind up 34% on both higher new unit shipments and repowering volume. Segment margin of 2% was down 330 basis points for the quarter and profit of $67 million was down 51% mainly driven by negative price, liquidated damages for execution delays on a handful of complicated projects including some legacy Alstom projects and higher losses in hydro and offshore as we began fully consolidating these entities in the fourth quarter.',\n",
              " \"The consolidation presented a headwind of about 220 basis points. Recall that we had to book loss reserves at the time of the Alstom deal and we continue to burn through the negative cash flow impact of those projects.

On free cash flow, we expect to face operating headwinds such as the PTC progress cycle reversing in renewables and we will spend more cash on restructuring at both Corporate and Power. In addition, we have a number of nonrecurring investments and commitments that create a drag on our free cash flow in 2019 but which will meaningfully lessen in 2020 and '21. These include transitioning to GE Capital supply chain financing program to MUFG and reducing factoring with GE Capital, Alstom pension contributions and legal settlements and the costs related to the preparation for our Healthcare business for our public separation.\",\n",

In aviation, we see 75% to 80% of the 2019 commercial engine revenues secured in the backlog, with a largely recurring service revenue stream of approximately $15 billion. We are maintaining margin levels consistent with pre-LEAP periods despite mix changes with a healthy new order book.

That progress cycle will begin reversing this year, as we transition to factory production and book revenue against those contracts. However, we see price declines moderating and within the level of our product cost reduction efforts going forward. This is our baseline today for 2019 as our plan continues to evolve.

I think that just speaks to the way we're able to communicate the value of our technology. We know in these businesses from Healthcare to renewables price is a reality.

We are clearly dealing with lower demand in equipment, encouraged by some of the share points in the US market here in the back half. But again, we want to make sure we focused on profitable share.

Situations where we receive projects in advance of constructing new equipment or where we received progress on projects and now we're in the phase of the project, where the payables and the costs are starting to come through.

Year-over-year 2.4x up and you're seeing CFM come down meaningfully over those same periods. Next year, CFM will come down again about I'd say more than 50% of CFM deliveries will be reduced next year but the LEAP also ramps from the 1,118 we had this year up to 1,800-plus. So that remixing continues to occur. We mentioned on the call that it was a drag in 2018 of 160 basis points.

So that takes time because it's not just a reporting exercise, right? It's a management exercise and making sure they not understand not only how they're being measured but how to go about actually getting better price, how to go about actually driving better material productivity. Execution in the field as well. Not only around cost but frankly more importantly around quality making sure we get into outages quickly and we solve issues for customers the first time and when we're not going back.

              "{1: \"Thank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us. Our comments are going to be a bit longer than usual this morning to help you understand where we are and where we're going. But rest assured, we'll leave as much time as we can for questions at the end.\",\n",
              " 2: \"First, I'd like to start by welcoming Steve to the GE team. I've known him for over a decade. Steve's already had positive impact here at GE and I'm sure, he'll do the same for you, our investors going forward. I'm here today because I believe in GE. There is no company on earth with a scale of GE's global reach, brand, talent and long-term customer relationships. We have leading technology in key infrastructure markets with high barriers to entry and strong aftermarket streams. We're poised to capture recurring revenues on a global installed base of almost 70,000 engines more than 70 -- 7,000 gas turbines and aero-derivatives, more than 40,000 onshore wind turbines and more than 4 million Healthcare Systems. In short, GE matters. We've identified clear opportunities to improve our performance and we are working to address them at root cause.\",\n",
              " 3: \"We have the right portfolio of strategy and I'm confident the company is capable of gaining profitable share and creating long-term value for our shareholders. So let me cover where we stand on providing an outlook. Then I'll address some of the company changes followed by updates on our results, the balance sheet, capital and power. Jamie will take you through more details on the quarter and then I'll wrap with some metrics and comments to help you frame the outlook for 2019 before Q&A.\",\n",
              " 4: \"Let's start with the outlook because investors want to know how we expect to perform financially and you should expect to come from a place of reality. Simply put the how much is important but the how is far more fundamental. We have a good line of sight in most of our businesses today including Aviation and Healthcare.\",\n",
              " 5: \"For the industrial portfolio in total, we will provide you with our outlook for organic growth and we'll do so directionally on operating margins and free cash flow. We will give you a more detailed outlook in the near term but not today. For Power, we are resetting the baseline. We are reviewing every single project and contract and digging deeper to understand costs and benefits with respect to restructuring, market and commercial execution, improvement opportunities, legacy project issues and our service operations. We're gaining more meaningful insights into the paths for near and long-term earnings and cash potential of this business. This work takes time especially with the new structure and leadership team.\",\n",
              " 6: \"In the spirit of providing you with all the information we have as soon as we have it, I'll speak to what I have found over the last 120 days. We were executing against the key priorities we laid out in June and again in October. Simply put deleveraging the balance sheet and strengthening our businesses starting with Power. Remember beyond Power, it's important to recognize the underlying strengths in our businesses where the story is about enhancing our competitive advantage and delivering for customers and shareholders.\",\n",
              " 7: \"With respect to delevering, we've taken the following actions: We've reduced the quarterly dividend retaining $4 billion per year; accelerated the sale of a portion of our BHGE ownership stake raising $3.7 billion; and changed the structure of our transaction with Wabtec enabling us to retain an incremental $2 billion stake. We're demonstrating our seriousness and the flexibility with respect to our decisions to recut the BHGE and Wabtec deals in particular. We closed Distributed Power for $2.8 billion of net cash in the quarter.\",\n",
              " 8: \"For the year, we signed or completed substantially all of our $20 billion industrial asset sale plan, which had targeted roughly $10 billion in proceeds. We also announced the sale of ServiceMax in the fourth quarter. We completed $8 billion of capital asset sales and other actions in the quarter bringing our total for the year to $15 billion, which were executed at book value or better. We're more than halfway through the total of $25 billion capital asset sale program, which we expect to complete this year.\",\n",
              " 9: \"Today, we have announced that we've reached an agreement in principle with the United States Department of Justice to settle the FIRREA investigation of WMC. GE will pay the United States a civil penalty of $1.5 billion consistent with our reserve recorded for this matter in the first quarter of last year. We've taken the following actions to strengthen our businesses.\",\n",
              " 10: \"In 2018, our corporate headquarters cost was $1.2 billion down $400 million from $1.6 billion in 2017. We have begun transferring a significant portion of headcount and activities that were previously managed at corporate to the segments or to third parties with over 6,500 full-time employees transferred to-date. We're confident that as we move more activity and headcount closer to those that are directly accountable, we will see additional savings.\",\n",
              " 11: \"Good examples include the recently announced agreement with Genpact around our global operations activities and the delayering and reorganization of our Global Growth Organization. Our changes in Power followed a similar approach. We have $1.6 billion of cost at Power headquarters and expect to produce that amount by $300 million for headquarter's overhead functions. And as we distribute the remaining cost to the business units, we expect that they will find additional savings over time.\",\n",
              " 12: \"We announced this week that we will be delayering the headquarter levels at Renewable Energy. And yesterday announced that we are bringing GE's grid, solar and storage assets into that business creating an end-to-end offering from renewables customers as the demand for renewable power generation and grid integration continues to grow globally. We're strengthening our senior team. We've brought in fresh eyes that are already having an impact.\",\n",
              " 13: \"We're combining new perspectives from strong external talent, proven GE leaders with domain expertise and entrepreneurial spirit, next-gen thinkers as well as leaders with deep customer relationships. From a governance perspective, Paula Reynolds joined our Board of Directors bringing extensive experience in both the Energy and Insurance industries. The majority of our Directors now are new since 2017 and I'm finding the Board deeply engaged in all matters of our business\",\n",
              " 14: \"Our audit committee also announced that they will move forward with the tender process for the appointment of GE's independent audit firm. And finally, we announced our plan to combine the digital businesses into an independently operated IoT Software business with employee equity a separate Board and the ability to raise capital and operate like a start-up. We're on the precipice of something great. We're getting a 100 years of domain and hardware expertise and growing out of our digital DNA over the last several decades.\",\n",
              " 15: 'As my friend, Jim Collins of \"good-to-great\" fame might say, it\\'s a start. But we have much more work to do. So let me now share with you, how I\\'ve talked with our team about how we will do it. Number one, is managing first and foremost for operational performance. Preparing for the earnings call, my first month on the job showed me that we often start with corporate and bring in the business leaders including the CEO later. We turned that around this quarter holding operating reviews first and then preparing for this call. Those reviews were tightly focused on the how we can do and how do we get better, more so than how do we explain what just happened. Let me give you an example.',\n",
              " 16: 'Previous P&L reviews focused on revenue, contribution margin and base cost and then, of course, operating profit. The same high-level framing I saw on the Board room. No more. We now get into much more operating detail, volume, price, mix, material and labor productivity overhead and operating expenses like R&D sales and marketing and G&A, all of which are critical to understanding and then improving the business.',\n",
              " 17: \"The second is a focus on putting our customer at the center of all we do. Over the past few months, I've spent time with our customers in China, the Middle East, Europe and here in the US. I've learned that what they value is not always aligned with how we measure our own performance.\",\n",
              " 18: \"Take quality. When I ask about quality internally, I often hear about our cost of quality, which measures our issues rather than how the customer experiences us. We're shifting our perspectives so that we understand and measure ourselves the way customers do and work backwards from there. The third area is having fewer and more impactful priorities. GE has ambition like no other company I've ever seen and that's mostly a good thing but we need to focus our attention to more of the things that matter most, so we can move them the furthest.\",\n",
              " 19: \"At a company level, we've committed to the two priorities I mentioned earlier: Deleveraging the balance sheet and strengthening the businesses starting with Power. I'd now like to address some of the areas of importance that are high on my priority list. First, our high-level financial results. We ended the year with adjusted EPS of $0.65. GAAP EPS of negative $2.43 and industrial free cash flow of $4.5 billion. Our backlog stands at $391 billion up 5% year-on-year with equipment at $89 billion up 4%; and service at $302 billion up 5%.\",\n",
              " 20: 'For the fourth quarter, our industrial free cash flow was $4.9 billion. While cash flow was negatively impacted by the weakness in Power, we were encouraged by the strong cash generation in the other businesses. We delivered adjusted EPS of $0.17 and GAAP EPS of $0.08. Jamie will take you through all this in more detail in a moment.',\n",
              " 21: \"Next to the balance sheet. As I've stated already, we are reducing our debt levels both at Industrial and GE Capital. We know full well that our shareholders own all debt obligations across GE but these are two distinct sets of businesses with different financing needs and different capital structures and therefore we analyze their leverage separately. In industrial, we are targeting a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of less than 2.5x over the next few years.\",\n",
              " 22: 'Our Healthcare, transportation and BHGE separations can provide sources of roughly $50 billion toward that goal. Our Healthcare team continues to prepare for public company separation and that is progressing very well. We expect to monetize up to just under 50% of our Healthcare business. I talked earlier to the GE Transportation merger with Wabtec and the amended terms to increase our cash proceeds and we will sell down our remaining 50% ownership in BHGE in an orderly manner over time building on the actions, we took in November.',\n",
              " 23: \"Overall our liquidity position remains strong with $16.8 billion of industrial cash and funding lines of $40 billion. Now on capital, we are targeting a debt-to-equity ratio of less than 4x by 2020. In 2018, we paid down capital's external debt balance by $21 billion and we executed $15 billion in asset sales at book more than half of our $25 billion asset disposition program. Capital ended the year with a $124 billion of assets including $15 billion of liquidity in line with our goal to materially shrink this business.\",\n",

And then finally on Power. Let me share with you the root causes of our underperformance as I see them today and the actions we're taking to address each one.\",\n",
              " 25: 'First as I said, last quarter we were late to embrace the realities of the secular and cyclical pressures in the business. Recent data suggests that the market for new generating capacity is settling in to the 25 to 30 gigawatts range for the foreseeable future. We continue to believe gas will play an important role in global electrification but we have to resize our cost structure, our capital expenses and our supply chains to this new reality now.',\n",
              " 26: \"As a result last year, we reduced headcount by 10,000 or 15% in the business, consolidated our footprint by 30% and took out $900 million of base cost exiting at a $1 billion lower run rate. Embracing market reality means a more appropriate revenue outlook, one that is further grounded in the reality of our $92 billion backlog rather than in the hope of new orders not yet won. Second Power faces a number of nonoperational headwinds and we expect a high water mark in this regard this year. These include legal settlements and legacy project erosion principally driven by the Alstom acquisition. There's also the runoff of the effects of past long-term receivables factoring and other programs.\",\n",
              " 27: 'Over the next few years, these effects should come down substantially. Third, we need to execute better. Running Power better means improved daily management in how we sell make and service our products. Let me give you a few examples. We had separate teams of managers commissioning new plants owning a warranty period and overseeing the services contracts after the warranty.',\n",
              " 28: 'Now, we present one face to the customer, who is accountable for the best long-term economic answer both for the customer and GE. We put the sales organization under one leader with deep domain expertise and are coordinating better on contract negotiations. We now have more experienced people, owning negotiations and responsible for project cost. We performed risk assessments of our existing 400 equipment contracts to identify cost and execution risks. We also performed a similar assessment on the 750 CSA contracts to identify price and utilization risk.',\n",
              " 29: \"We have overhauled our commercial underwriting processes to set more realistic commitments and returns from the start. This is hard work but I'm encouraged by the Power's team's dedication to proactively address these issues at their root cause. Fixing Power will take time and in turn will take time for the changes, we're making to our daily operations to be reflected in our financial results but we are improving and I'm confident that those changes will come.\",\n",

Orders were $34.1 billion down 1% reported and up 4% organically with particular strength in equipment orders up 7% organically driven by aviation commercial engines and renewables. The services orders were up 1% organically. Revenues were up 5%, industrial segment revenues were up 2% reported and 8% organically driven by renewables Aviation Oil & Gas Healthcare and Transportation.\",\n",

Industrial profit margins were 7.5% in the quarter down 150 basis points year-over-year on a reported and organic basis driven by significant declines in Power and Renewables. For the year, margins were down 80 basis points organically. Industrial profit was down 16% in the quarter with Aviation, Healthcare and Baker Hughes GE all delivering strong profit growth offset mostly by Power. Specifically Aviation had another outstanding quarter and year expanding total year margins while shipping over 1,100 LEAP engines. Net earnings per share was $0.07, which includes losses from discontinued operations related to GE Capital. GAAP continuing EPS was $0.08 and adjusted EPS was $0.17.',\n",

Continuing EPS was $0.08 and we had $0.06 of gains principally from the sale of Distributed Power. As you will recall in the third quarter, we booked the $22 billion impairment charge related to Power goodwill based on our best estimate at that time. And during the fourth quarter, we finalized our analysis and booked an incremental $69 million charge for Power following the third quarter charge. We also recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $94 million in renewables at our Hydro business. Combined these charges were $0.02 impact. On restructuring and other items, we incurred $0.07 of charges principally at Corporate and Power as we continue to resize those segments in line with our stated plan including $0.02 of charges related to business development transaction expenses and $0.01 for our share of Baker Hughes GE's restructuring.\",\n",
              " 36: 'Lastly, we realized a $0.01 negative impact from US tax reform as we updated our estimate of the transition tax and other aspects of the enactment of the new law. Our current accrual reflects the effects of tax reform enactment based on guidance issued through year-end. Excluding these items adjusted EPS was $0.17 in the quarter.',\n",
              " 37: 'Moving to cash, adjusted industrial free cash flow was $4.9 billion for the quarter, $1.9 billion lower than the prior year driven primarily by a lower progress collections. Income depreciation and amortization totaled $2.3 billion. Working capital was positive $2.3 billion for the quarter as we reduced over $1 billion of inventory on a higher fourth quarter volume and grew progress collections by $500 million primarily in renewables from strong PTC-driven orders.',\n",
              " 38: 'Contract assets were a source of cash of $900 million as we saw higher services billings in aviation driven by higher fleet utilization and spare parts consumption from strong air traffic and we spent about $1 billion in gross CapEx or $600 million ex-Baker Hughes GE. For the year, we generated $4.5 billion of adjusted industrial free cash flow and we ended the year with higher volume in the fourth quarter as is typical for our businesses. And to provide you with more detail, Power used $2.7 billion in free cash flow for the year due to a combination of restructuring costs, nonoperational headwinds as well as execution and market issues.',\n",

We ended the fourth quarter with $16.8 billion of industrial cash in the bank excluding Baker Hughes GE. And for the total year, we had industrial free cash flow of $4.5 billion. We paid dividends of $4.2 billion and as of the first quarter of 2019, you'll recall that the dividend is decreasing to $0.01 per share per quarter, which will preserve about $4 billion of cash in 2019. We generated cash proceeds of $5.9 billion net of taxes related to our industrial disposition principally Industrial Solutions, Value-Based Care and Dis Power. And together with Wabtec that gets to the more than $10 billion we had talked about previously.\",\n",
              " 40: 'Earlier in the year, we assumed $6 billion of debt from GE Capital to fund the principal pension plan, which was completed in the third quarter. Alstom and GE exercised their JV redemption rights and call options, which we settled for $3.1 billion in the fourth quarter. These entities operate at a loss. So the consolidation of 100% of the financials negatively impacted fourth quarter and will be an income headwind for us of about $300 million in 2019. We also completed a secondary offering for approximately 100 million Baker Hughes GE shares as well as a direct stock buyback with Baker Hughes GE for 65 million shares bringing our ownership stake to 50.4% in the fourth quarter.',\n",
              " 41: \"These actions combined with other Baker Hughes GE buybacks during the year totaled $4.4 billion in cash proceeds. The $2.5 billion of other cash includes a number of items including about $900 million of investments in our Aviation business primarily from the first half of the year; $900 million of short data derivative hedge settlements that we used to mitigate risks across the portfolio; and $400 million of FX translation on our non-US dollar-denominated cash. Running with a higher cash balance will help us address inter-quarter funding needs. In line with our goal to reduce reliance on short-term funding, peak short-term funding needs declined from $19.7 billion in the fourth quarter of '17 to $14.8 billion in the fourth quarter of '18. These were funded with commercial paper and some utilization of our credit facilities.\",\n",

At the end of the year, commercial paper outstanding was $3 billion and we had access to $40 billion of committed revolving credit facilities with zero drawn. These lines are available to draw at any time and they don't have financial covenants ratings triggers or material adverse change clauses. As you know, our credit rating was downgraded from A to BBB+ with a stable outlook in early fourth quarter.\",\n",

We remain committed to our financial policy of a target single A rating a leverage level of less than 2.5x net debt-to-EBITDA and ultimately a dividend level in line with our peers.

We plan to make significant progress toward this goal by the end of 2020 and as a reminder when we speak about net debt, we're talking about debt adjusted for pensions, operating leases and a portion of preferred stock and cash. Measured on this basis, GE Industrial net debt at the end of 2018 was $55 billion.

Over the next two years, we expect to generate additional sources of cash from asset sales, including $10 billion in 2019 from completing our GE Capital $25 billion asset reduction plan. We'll have cash from the pay down of most of the debt transferred to GE and capital support from GE. We have reached an agreement in principle on WMC that we expect to conclude expeditiously. And in 2019 and 2020, GE Capital will pay down $25 billion of scheduled debt maturities and continue to contribute about $2 billion per year of capital to our insurance businesses as previously disclosed.

Equipment orders grew 20%, driven by continued strong momentum of the LEAP engine program up 56% versus prior year. Military engine orders were up 69% driven by the F414 and service orders grew 7%.

Utilization rates are over 95%. We continue to improve the cost position of the LEAP and over the last two years, we've taken out more than 40% of the cost of the engine and are ahead on the learning curve initially laid out for the program.

In addition, we have a number of nonrecurring investments and commitments that create a drag on our free cash flow in 2019 but which will meaningfully lessen in 2020 and '21. These include transitioning to GE Capital supply chain financing program to MUFG and reducing factoring with GE Capital, Alstom pension contributions and legal settlements and the costs related to the preparation for our Healthcare business for our public separation.\",\n",

In aviation, we see 75% to 80% of the 2019 commercial engine revenues secured in the backlog, with a largely recurring service revenue stream of approximately $15 billion. We are maintaining margin levels consistent with pre-LEAP periods despite mix changes with a healthy new order book. With these in mind, we see high single-digit revenue growth and low single-digit profit growth.',\n",

The business is coming through the PTC cycle and onshore wind, which contributed to strong cash performance in 2018, as a result of progress build. That progress cycle will begin reversing this year, as we transition to factory production and book revenue against those contracts. However, we see price declines moderating and within the level of our product cost reduction efforts going forward. This is our baseline today for 2019 as our plan continues to evolve.

Situations where we receive projects in advance of constructing new equipment or where we received progress on projects and now we're in the phase of the project, where the payables and the costs are starting to come through.

Next year, CFM will come down again about I'd say more than 50% of CFM deliveries will be reduced next year but the LEAP also ramps from the 1,118 we had this year up to 1,800-plus. So that remixing continues to occur. We mentioned on the call that it was a drag in 2018 of 160 basis points.

What I'm really referring to is making sure that every day the folks in the field, the folks in the factories, the folks in the labs understand what the key operating metrics are that they are responsible for that feed into better margins both at the growth in the operating level in this business. So that takes time because it's not just a reporting exercise, right? It's a management exercise and making sure they not understand not only how they're being measured but how to go about actually getting better price, how to go about actually driving better material productivity. Execution in the field as well. Not only around cost but frankly more importantly around quality making sure we get into outages quickly and we solve issues for customers the first time and when we're not going back. Those are the source of things. And it is a big organization. It's a global organization. This is going to take a little while.
